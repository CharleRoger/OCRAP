		#LOC_OCRAP_single_title = OCRAP Common Rocket Unit
		#LOC_OCRAP_single_description = The Orbital Common Rocket Assembly Platform banks on simple parts and mass production to undercut competitors with the cheapest route to orbit available.\nThe singular component of the system is this tiny all-in-one liquid rocket booster which can be clustered to form bespoke launch vehicles for any application.\n It's basically a couple of drain pipes welded together with a nozzle on the end.
		#LOC_OCRAP_linear_title = OCRAP Linear Cluster
		#LOC_OCRAP_linear_description = We've prefabricated some clusters of OCRAP boosters to speed up production and help mitigate certain technical limitations.\nThis linear cluster is useful for padding out the sides of larger clusters that don't quite meet your thrust quota.
		#LOC_OCRAP_square_title = OCRAP Square Cluster
		#LOC_OCRAP_square_description = We've prefabricated some clusters of OCRAP boosters to speed up production and help mitigate certain technical limitations.\nThis square cluster uses variable throttling to simulate gimballing, with wider clusters offering a greater degree of control.
		#LOC_OCRAP_triangular_title = OCRAP Triangular Cluster
		#LOC_OCRAP_triangular_description = We've prefabricated some clusters of OCRAP boosters to speed up production and help mitigate certain technical limitations.\nThis triangular cluster uses variable throttling to simulate gimballing, with wider clusters offering a greater degree of control.
		#LOC_OCRAP_hexagonal_title = OCRAP Hexagonal Cluster
		#LOC_OCRAP_hexagonal_description = We've prefabricated some clusters of OCRAP boosters to speed up production and help mitigate certain technical limitations.\nThis hexagonal cluster uses variable throttling to simulate gimballing, with wider clusters offering a greater degree of control.
