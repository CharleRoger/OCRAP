OCRAP is a mod for Kerbal Space Program which adds clusters of tiny liquid rocket boosters based on the [OTRAG rocket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OTRAG_(rocket)), a concept for extremely cheap, modular launch vehicles which was developed and tested in the 1970s and 80s but retired before it was ever used commercially.

OCRAP stands for Orbital Common Rocket Assembly Platform and, since Kerbals speak backwards Spanish, also expresses the Spanish word *parco*, meaning "frugal". It has no other meaning.
